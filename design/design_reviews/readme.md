 This folder is for storing Braid programs that are written to test the design
 of the language and make notes about what works and what does not.

 The structure of this section of the project should follow:

```
/design_reviews/<date of the review>/
```

Then under that directory place any programs you have written to test the design.

At the bottom of each program, have a multiline comment where you document any
review notes and thoughts that occur while writing that program.
