# RFCs Section
This directory stores all design proposals from their first draft 
to their final state. This will help manage full documentation of
the Stet language.

RFCs are named with the following pattern `<Issue>-<title>.md`, the
`<Issue>` is the issue number associated with the GitHub issue that
was created to track the particular RFC document.

When an RFC is finalized and moved into active development, the name
of the RFC is appended with `-accepted`. During development, if 
edge cases or changes need to be made to the design the RFC is updated
and kept as `-accepted`.  Once all tasks are complete and merged
the RFC suffix is changed from `-accepted` to `-final`.
